				---SETUP---
SSH into rapsberry pi:

	ssh port@portspi

Had to make sure that the raspberry pi was updated:

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade

I then needed to run the script from get.docker.com for install and setup of docker on the pi:

	curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

Got hit with an error while running that command that looked like: 

	E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configu	re -a' to correct the problem.

However after runnign the command stated in the error, it fixed up my depackage configuration and I was off and running with Docker on my Raspberry Pi. Had to have been one of the most straight forward installs I have had on my Pi.


			--- Container #1 : MySQL ---

I wanted to start off with a MySQl image because I have a lot of experience with SQL and MySQL and felt like being able to understand the appliation will eliminate some confusing I would have had if I wouldve started with an appliation new to me.

Started by going to https://hub.docker.com and finding the page for the MySQL image. The install command was simply:

	docker pull mysql

But nothing is ever that simple because I got hit with an error code:
	
	Using default tag: latest
	permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.47/images/create?fromImage=mysql&tag=latest": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

Turns out I still needed to login to docker through the command line before I can execute any pulls. I could do this using this command:

	docker login -u "porjohns"

That didnt really do anything for the error I was getting on the mysql pull request for the docker image but it did allow me greater number of pull requests from docker. But eventually I figured out that the solution to the pull request error was that i needed root permission, so adding sudo resulted in a successful pull.

	sudo docker pull mysql

So lets try to run the docker image and see what happens:

	sudo docker run mysql

Got an error back stating:
	
	You need to specify one of the following as an environment variable:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD

So I will set the root password:
 
	sudo docker run --name my-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=****** -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -d mysql:latest


	sudo docker exec -it my-mysql bash
